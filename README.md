# sca-codequeens
Project repository for the She Code Africa mentorship program

## What you should know
This repository contains a demo-app project created in the `demo` feature branch. The `demo-app/` project is where we will be doing most of our learning and practice of React.
We will have another directory that contains the main project for this program. 

## Setting up the Demo project
- Clone this repository by running the `git clone https://github.com/meekg33k/sca-code-queens.git` command. Be careful to clone this repository into the right location on your local machine.
- You should see a `demo-app/` directory on your machine if you've cloned this correctly. If you can't see that directory, it's likely because you're on the `master` branch, run a `git checkout demo` command to checkout the demo feature branch. You should now see the `demo-app` directory.
- Run `cd demo-app` to change your working directory to `demo-app`.
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed for running this project.

## Running the Demo project
Assuming you're in the `demo-app` directory, run `npm start` from your terminal to start the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in any browser of your choice view the app.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
This should complete the initial setup of the demo app.
